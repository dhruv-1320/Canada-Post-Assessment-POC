This POC/Assessment from Canada Post is toprovide a Canadian official with a summary on how Canada is performing against overall G7 countries (G7 Countries are Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and United States) in 4 areas and for an analyst to probe the data set and identify countries that would offer the best quality of life based on their performance in the 4 selected metrics:
1.	Birth Rate
2.	Business Tax Rate
3.	GDP per Capita 
4.	Health Exp % GDP
I have used Power BI for data modelling and Visualizing and getting insigths from the data. Used multiple Dax queries and created calculated custom columns for multiple columns merged.
